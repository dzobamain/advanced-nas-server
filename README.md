# advanced nas server

NAS server for storing your data in one place.
Choose a device on which you want to store the data and install this program on it.

To get/store data, connect to the same WLAN as your device and open
http://localhost:port, which will be shown after the server starts.

Not everyone who connects will be able to get access — this project has a database that defines who is allowed access and what permissions they have.

# install
